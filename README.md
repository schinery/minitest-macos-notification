# Minitest macOS Notification

Simple macOS notification reporter for Minitest Reporters, based on the [minitest-osx](https://github.com/tombell/minitest-osx) gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minitest-macos-notification"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-macos-notification

## Usage

Add this to your test helper:

```ruby
require "minitest/autorun"
require "minitest/macos_notification"
```

Then in your `Minitest::Reporters.use!` block use:

```ruby
Minitest::Reporters.use!(
  [
    Minitest::Reporters::SpecReporter.new,
    Minitest::Reporters::MacosNotificationReporter.new(title: "A title")
  ],
  ENV,
  Minitest.backtrace_filter
)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
